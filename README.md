# pacMan
This is a simple pac man game that allows two players to play against each other in what is commonly known as a one-player game. Each player would have their own set of controls (arrow keys and WASD keys) on the same keyboard. 

Goal: Collect pellets as food. Find the power-up [once it appears] in order to eat the other player in the game. If the two players collide before either one of them has eaten the power-up, they will both die and the game will end. The game will end once one player is eaten. 

An optional gameplay may be added to allow computer-controlled characters to join the game to make it more difficult. You must survive from them while still trying to achieve the original goal of eating the other player. If one player is touched by the computer-controlled characters, they will die and the game will end with the winner being the player that survives. 

*note* Graphics will not be the same as the original PacMan game.
